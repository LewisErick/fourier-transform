Demonstration Notebook of Fourier Transform Intuition in Python for the article:
**Meet The Fabulous "Fast Fourier Transform**. <a href="https://medium.com/@luis061997/meet-the-fabulous-fast-fourier-transform-663b08952c40">Check it out!</a>

### Interactive Visualization
Go to https://lewiserick.github.io/fourier-transform/ for the interactive visualization

#### Controls
- Click in the graph to cycle between
  1. Fourier Transform of the sample function.
  2. The integrand that gives the data point selected in the Fourier Transform graph.
  3. The original sample function from which the integrand comes from.
- Hover over the graph to display the coordinates of the data point being hovered.
